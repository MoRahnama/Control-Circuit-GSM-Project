# Designing a Control Circuit Using GPRS and GSM Technology

This project focuses on designing a control circuit utilizing third-generation mobile network infrastructure and an 8-bit AVR microprocessor. The SIM900 GSM/GPRS shield is implemented to connect the hardware system of this project to the GSM mobile network, providing an opportunity to establish online communication with the user interface via the internet.

## System Modes

The system operates in two main modes:

### Offline Mode

In offline mode, the user sends control text messages to the hardware system through GSM. Upon receipt, the embedded microprocessor deciphers the message and makes the necessary changes to the system.

### Online Mode

In online mode, the user takes direct control of the system via an online user interface, accessible through a web browser or a specialized Android application developed specifically for this project. The hardware system, upon establishing online communication with the user interface, responds to inputs and adjusts accordingly.
